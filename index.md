<br>
<br>
Following recent developments relating to COVID-19, the OWASP Foundation has made the difficult decision to postpone the Global AppSec Dublin Conference to February 15-19, 2021. See the blog post for more information.
<br>
<br>
Formerly known as AppSec EU, the Global AppSec Conference is the premier application security conference for developers and security experts. Designed for private and public sector infosec professionals, the OWASP three day training and two day conference equips developers, defenders, and advocates to build a more secure web.
<br>
<br>
Join us for a celebration of leading application security technologies, speakers, prospects, and community, in a unique event that will build on everything you already know to expect from an OWASP Global Conference."
