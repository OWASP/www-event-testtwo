<b>CALL FOR TRAINERS (CfT) & SUBMISSION  </b>

The Programme Team is formally issuing a call for Trainers, opening <b>January 27,  2020</b>. 

As with previous Global AppSec events, we would like to run a number of different training courses of varying lengths over the three days of the conference.

Trainers can apply to give 1, 2, or 3 day classes.  Multiple applications are allowed; one application per class. The training target audience will include developers interested in security as well as security professionals.

We are looking for world-class training courses applicable at all levels - from someone new to the application security field to advanced topics for experienced professionals. However, all training submissions should have a focus on practical skills which are immediately applicable to an attendeeâ€™s job.  The course should also have a significant hands-on element, with tasks and exercises to attempt during the training.
