### About Dublin:

Dublin is more than just a great conference location. Combining a solid reputation for education and innovation, with great accessibility, it is no coincidence that Dublin is now the European headquarters of many of the world’s leading corporations, and a centre for academic research and innovation. As the home to many of the world’s top ICT, Financial and Pharmaceutical corporations, it is a serious place to do business.

Yet, Dublin has not forgotten its roots and is steeped in a rich cultural heritage that begs to be explored. All year round, the city is alive with music, art and theatre of all kinds and, of course, art galleries and museums abound. All complemented by an impressive range of restaurants, cafés and shops
